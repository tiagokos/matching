# problems

- Input has to be validated (id / integer)

- Input has to be from a valid worker (id can be valid but nonexistent in the data set)

- What about if list of jobs is huge (billons of jobs... or billon of workers)?

- Response has to contain data (3 jobs), no matter what...

- Is it worth to serialize the whole input?
