# problems

- input has to be validated (id / integer)
- input has to be from a valid worker (id can be valid but nonexistent in the data set)
- what about if list of jobs is huge (billons of jobs... or billon of workers)?
- response has to contain data (3 jobs), no matter what...
- is it worth to serialize the whole input?
- should I cache all the possibilities from the beginning and keep results in some in-memory cache?


# questions

- do I have to care about inactive workers?
- is it possible for a job to have 0 workers needed?
- do I have to care about old jobs (start date before than the present day)?
